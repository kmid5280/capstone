## Summary

"CountrySearch" makes it easy to get information about any country by fielding results from multiple sources. Results of a search include relevant information from YouTube, Wikipedia, and the State Department. This makes it easy to get information from more than one source through the convenience of a single app, rather than having to visit several websites separately.

(Note: State Department API currently disabled until further notice.)

## Technology
"CountrySearch" relies on JSON and AJAX calls to retrieve data from APIs and render them onto the page. YouTube results are displayed first, followed by Wikipedia and State Department information.
